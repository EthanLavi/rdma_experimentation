# Venice

An attempt at fixing loopback. This project is more for the learning benefits and isn't currently intended to be used by anyone else.

## Origins

The name 'Venice' originated because the inspiration for this was the need to understand the Rome project. As Venice is sinking, the name is meant to be ironic.
